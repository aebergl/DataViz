# daboxplot.m

A lightweight function for visualizing data using boxplots - an alternative to the cumbersome and not very pretty built-in Matlab boxplot. 

- Loves 2-level factorial data (multiple gorups and conditions), but accepts one-factor data also
- Easily customizable for emphasizing data features and maximizing readability
- Does not require the groups/conditions to have the same number of data points
- Can handle different input types (cell or numeric array) 
- Exports many handles for further customization
- Neat

See daboxplot_demo.m for the code generating the examples shown below
