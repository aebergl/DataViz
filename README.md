# daboxplot.m

A lightweight function for visualizing 2-level factorial data (conditions x groups) using boxplots - something that the built-in Matlab boxplot function cannot do. Goes hand in hand with two-way ANOVA tests. 

- Created for 2-level factorial data, but also works with one-factor data
- Easily customizable for emphasizing data features and maximizing readability
- Does not require groups/conditions to have the same number of data points
- Can handle different input types (cell or numeric array) 
- Exports many handles for further customization
- Neat
