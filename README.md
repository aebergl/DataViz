# daboxplot

A lightweight function that plots boxplots organized by condition and colored by group. Does not require the groups to be of the same size. Can handle different input types (cell or array). Includes quite a few essential options (data scatter and jitter, whisker length, outliers, box fill, transparency, etc.) and exports many handles for further customization. Some examples are provided below. See daboxplot_demo.m for the code generating the examples.
